            I am a passionate learner at Algonquin College. I enjoy exploring new technologies and building creative solutions.

            Apart from academics, I like engaging in community projects. My goal is to contribute to meaningful 
            work that has a positive impact on society. One of my dreams is to start my own tech initiative one day.
